Targeted functions of this calculator

Calculating the differentiated payment. To do this, the user may run the program specifying the interest, the number of periods, and credit principal.

The ability to calculate the same values as in the previous stage for annuity payment (principal, count of periods, and value of the payment). The user specifies all the known parameters using command-line arguments, so there will be one unknown parameter. This is the value that the user wants to calculate.

Handling invalid parameters. It's a good idea to show an error message Incorrect parameters if invalid parameters were input.
